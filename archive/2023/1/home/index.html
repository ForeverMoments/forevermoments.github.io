      	<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
        <p>I make Youtube content, on things relating to the history of the software we use every day, mostly Microsoft products.</p>
		<h2>Brief History, and Youtube</h2>
		<p>My whole life, I was always curious about computers. Trying to figure out different things since I began using computers. In 2016, I got curious about the history of computers, including playing with some old Windows versions on Copy.sh's online emulator/hypervisor. By the End of 2017, my interest had tapered off (didn't die, I created my first VM in 2018, running Ubuntu 18.04), until early 2020, when the COVID pandemic hit, I decided to revisit the old hobby and began creating my VMs with Windows installed, and loved experimenting around with it. In June 2020, I created the Youtube Channel "Forever Moments: Computer Crazy", the first part of the name comes from two words that I thought looked nice with each other, and that is the reason. The second part came from the fact that I love computers.</p>
