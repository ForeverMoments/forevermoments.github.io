      	<h1>Hello, and Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hello I make videos on tech related stuff like Windows OS, MS Office and more!</p>
        <p>I enjoy computers! Trying to learn everything I can. This is just a website in its beta state. But sure there is more to come.</p>
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>My interest began in 2016. Iused to play with a lot of Windows Parodies and in-broser emulator copy.sh, but I began to lose interest in late 2017. My interest for programming rose, and I joined Scratch on March 13, 2017. but I regan interest in 2020 and you can see where that broght me</p>
        <h2>Youtube Life</h2>
        <p>On June 11, 2020 I started a Youtube Channel to share my interests with the world. (even thought I haven't uploaded a video since June 30) and  I've been planning a name since 2016 "Forever Moments" was my original idea, but I added Computer Crazy to tell my viewers what I do. </p>
