      	<h1>Hello, and Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hello I make videos on tech related stuff like Windows OS, MS Office and more!<br>
        I enjoy computers! Trying to learn everything I can. This is just a website in its beta state. But sure there is more to come.</p>
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>My interest began in 2016. I used to play with a lot of Windows Parodies and in-broser emulator copy.sh, but I began to lose interest in late 2017. My interest for programming rose, and I joined Scratch on March 13, 2017. but I regan interest in 2020 and you can see where that broght me</p>
        <h2>Youtube Life</h2>
        <p>On June 11, 2020 I started a Youtube Channel to share my interests with the world. I've been planning a name since 2016 "Forever Moments" was my original idea, but I added Computer Crazy to tell my viewers what I do. </p>
        <h1> MAJOR UPDATE JUNE 2022!!!</h1>
        <p>As you can see from the video I uploaded on June 11, 2022, I have made some changes to the website. An attempt to make the website cleaner and fix some issues. In the <a href="https://forevermoments.github.io/archive/">archive</a> it will be listed as "2022-2" More major updates will come. <br> I also am to make the attempt to make a Linux Distro, and If i do, I will name it JarOS. <br> Stay Tuned!</p>
        <h1>Beta Website</h1>
	  <p>You can download and set up the beta website <a href="https://forevermoments.github.io/archive/2022/2/beta/">here</a></p>
